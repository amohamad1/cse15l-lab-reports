### Lab Report 3: Commands

The command chosen is less

The first option is -e, which exits less once the last line of the file is reached a second time.

Example 1: Using this command on the file rr37.txt in the biomed subdirectory:

```
less -e rr37.txt
```
This will open the file in less as usual:

But once we scroll to the end of the file, less automatically exits, and we are back in the command line:

Another option is `-M` which adds more useful infomation to the command prompt at the bottom, such line numbers and percentage of the file read.
