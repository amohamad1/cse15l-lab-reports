### Lab Report 3: Commands

The command chosen is less

The first option is -e, which exits less once the last line of the file is reached a second time.

Example 1: Using this command on the file rr37.txt in the biomed subdirectory:

```
less -e rr37.txt
```
This will open the file in less as usual:

But once we scroll to the end of the file, less automatically exits, and we are back in the command line:

Another option is `-M` which adds more useful infomation to the command prompt at the bottom, such line numbers and percentage of the file read.

Less also has usefull commands when opening files, such as the `/string`  which searches the opened file for the string given, and highlights the strings that contain the search query. You can then press `n` to go to the next occurance of the string.
